            </p>
            <p>Using ICS-309's to create Net Logs - Effective for AUXC's with
            poor hand writing and also provides time stamp</p>
            <p>Posting GPS Reports - If deployed, people need to know where we
            are</p>
            <p>Implementing Tactical Addresses - Critical when being
            deployed</p>
            <p>Comfortable with WLE Forms - I constantly review existing and new
            forms to be ready when asked for one</p>
            <p>I am comfortable with all the aspects of Winlink that have been
            exercised so far. Occasionally have trouble finding the menu item I
            know is out there but cannot remember where it is. But eventually I
            get there, if only after consulting HELP. How to fill in the blanks
            on ICS Forms can still be a puzzle. Message numbering still a bit
            fuzzy as well.</p>
            <p>Running different types of sessions (Packet, VARA FM, etc.)</p>
            <p>Compiling messages through forms</p>
            <p>Creating global folder and moving messages</p>
            <p>I am good with the 213 form, 309 and tactical addresses.</p>
            <p>Finding potential gateways depending on my location</p>
            <p>Use of tactical address, when required</p>
            <p>sending attachments, especially photos, getting them small enough to sending</p>
            <p>VHF and HF operation as well as telnet over my mobile hotspot</p>
            <p>After three years of practice, I feel pretty comfortable with
            messages, re-sizing, forms, tactical addresses, catalog requests,
            etc.</p>
            <p>I am very comfortable with the using Vara FM to send radio traffic.</p>
            <p>I feel competent sending forms and replying.</p>
            <p>I can archive and save files</p>
            <p>I can use folders effectively</p>
            <p>I can do attachments with success</p>
            <p>Comfortable with forms and attachments. No issues replying to
            forms. No issue with resizing photographs. I can get images out of
            my phone with the right USB cable. I can handle most of the Windows
            configuration issues that come up, although sometimes it is amazing
            how long it takes to get things working for others.</p>
            <p>Creating Winlink messages</p>
            <p>Using tactical addresses</p>
            <p>Using ICS USA forms</p>
            <p>Attaching/resizing/rotating/cropping images</p>
            <p>Using RF to transmit/receive Winlink messages (although I am
            RMS-limited due to location)</p>
            <p>Creating and using Personal and Global folders</p>
            <p>I think that I am fairly comfortable with at least the basic
            functions of Winlink Express. Basic messages, forms, and using
            tactical addresses (although occasionally we forget to switch to the
            tactical address as the sender).</p>
            <p>Generally, I can troubleshoot why connections are not being made
            or why the computer and the radio won't talk to each other. This is
            a hazard of having multiple radios, different soundcards, and more
            than one computer that has WLE on it. That troubleshooting would be
            a good exercise, though, for a field operation. Random computer,
            random radio, random sound card ? make it work.</p>

            <p>Using winlink express in general. Sending and receiving messages.
            Using forms including catalog requests. Attaching files and images.
            Keeping winlink express updated.</p>

            <p>I am comfortable sending and receiving telnet; completing 213s;
            adding attachments; resizing photos</p>

            <p>I can add my personal call sign to a Winlink instance. Using a
            flash drive, I can enter my Winlink registration number and my VARA
            license numbers to a Winlink instance.</p>
            
            <p>I can enter, enable, and disable tactical call signs.</p>
            
            <p>Given an ICS-205, I can modify the VFO frequency of a Kenwood
            TM-V71 radio to send and receive digital transmissions.</p>
            
            <p>I can assemble and operate a kit of a PC computer, a Digirig lite
            sound card and a Kenwood TM-V71 radio. With reference to the
            original Digirig device, see "weaknesses" below.</p>
            
            <p>I can create and delete personal and global folders, and I can
            explain which type (global folders) can be used across users of a
            Winlink instance.</p>
            
            <p>I can successfully download and re-size cell phone pictures and
            can send them as attachments to email messages.</p>
            
            <p>I can successfully retrieve and employ a number of ICS forms that
            are available within Winlink.</p>
            
            <p>I can create and send a CSV version of an ICS-309.</p>
            
            <p>I can take the necessary steps to modify the two versions of an
            ICS-213 message that contain an error.</p>
            
            <p>I can limit, using a Winlink feature, messages to be
            downloaded.</p>

            <p>I am getting more comfortable with generating ICS 213s, finding
            frequencies to use with VARA FM, hooking up my equipment (basic,
            basic!), saving communications to a global file immediately,
            transferring a picture to my computer, image sizing.</p>

            <p>I feel most comfortable with using Winlink Express as an
            alternative to normal internet email. I try to use WE as an
            alternative when emailing other ham radio operators for the purpose
            of gaining experience. I am also comfortable using the ICS-213 form
            since it is often included in CARES and YCARES Weekly Winlink
            assignments.</p>

            <p>Download/create messages, reply/open attachments; send/resize,
            attach ICS forms; use Telnet, use RMS (less successfully), Tactical
            names, folder setup.</p>

            <p>Aspects of Winlink Express that I am most comfortable with: The
            tasks that we typically work on during a six week cycle I am
            comfortable with. If individuals participate in these activities
            regularly, an operational competence is easily within a 2 - 3 cycle
            range</p>

            <p>ICS Forms, NET Control, Global Forms, Tactical Address</p>

            <p>"Standard" forms, editing, attaching photos, basic GPS operation,
            and pulling forms from the catalog. I feel comfortable with these
            tasks because we've practiced them on a regular basis and formed a
            certain familiarity.</p>

                Question 2: List a few things you need to work on or where some further
                or more in-depth training would help. This can include Winlink
                Express features or process-related things.
            </p>
            <p>Digipeating - I need to practice more so it becomes second
            nature</p>
            <p>Creating Forms - Same as above and currently have not been able
            to take any sent to me and populate web page with it</p>
            <p>My problems with Winlink are ones of self-induced errors; e.g.,
            typing errors, forgetting to use/disable Tactical Address, wrong
            week number, carelessness in general.</p>
            <p>Changing a RMS station on a form; even after successfully
            connecting as a test, filling out the form and then trying to send
            it only to find out the RMS no long accepts the connection to send
            the form
            </p>
            <p>It may be beneficial (and more work for the net control person
            unless done in a small work group in advance), to try and inject
            scenarios that may be experienced during an event. While taking
            pictures, attaching, etc. are all valuable skills, putting those
            into context via an event. Perhaps, the whole 6 week cycle is
            managed as a shift and each week is essentially a new task within
            that operating period. It's kind of how the tasks each week are done
            getting more difficult but in this case, it would be replying to a
            form, sending a form, getting a response and then adding the folders
            for open/closed messages.</p>
            <p>Folks need more practice and experience setting up their own call
            sign and then a tactical call sign on a different computer. It's
            also the issue of closing out and removing their call sign but
            leaving a club call on the computer. The process of establishing a
            work station at a remote site using city/county gear is a bit
            different and very limited for practicing. For those in LO,
            encourage somehow the usage of city equipment where they borrow an
            orange kit or stop by and use the work station at 214.</p>
            <p>I need to understand the GPS features more. That is still unclear
            along with mapping.</p>
            <p>I can send forms, but which form to use? This is unclear.</p>
            <p>GPS input (just need to work out usb ports on my device)</p>
            <p>I'm less comfortable with all of the steps to be completed at the
            end of a shift, mainly due to lack of repetition. I've got the
            write-up about what's required, but haven't had to do it for some
            time. Also, I need to be more diligent about backing up and
            archiving.</p>
            <p>I feel pretty good with the tool. Been using it for years so it
            doesn't surprise me often.</p>
            <p>I worry about the group understanding handoffs at the end of a
            shift. This means global folders, what to do to generate logs that
            are useful, and how to deal with tactical addresses when handing
            off. All process stuff.</p>
            <p>On the process side, making decisions about message numbering. In
            order for the 309 to work, we probably have to put our message
            numbers in the Subject line. When is a photo of a message
            acceptable, and when do we type it in. the 213 is the most used, but
            we should explore others, too more often. I do not think we should
            do this, but it would be great if we could find an adult education
            class for our "computer tech challenged" members we could refer them
            to. It's basic stuff. File space, text editor, file types,
            configuring the sound card, etc.</p>
            <p>Transferring images from cellphone-to-computer using a data transfer cable</p>
            <p>Transferring Winlink/VARA FM credentials from a thumb drive to a computer</p>
            <p>Archiving Winlink messages</p>
            <p>I would like to figure out DireWolf and start using that for my
            AX.25 functionality. In addition, some more work on backup and
            cross-computer work (I believe you use WinMerge?) so I can move old
            messages off old computers and build an archive of the stuff. It
            would also be helpful for the KD7ZDO system(s).</p>
            
            <p>I would also like to do some more with pre-planning for RMS' when
            not connected to the internet. For instance, you know you are going
            camping and there will be no internet where you are, how do you prep
            for 2m/70cm RMS' that will be close to your remote location? It
            might be an interesting exercise to have people attach a list of
            RMS' for a designated location for one of their check-ins.</p>
            
            <p>Not for everyone, but we should consider perhaps making some form
            templates we can use. Your useage of the CERT Form 1 is a great
            example. If we know that these are things we are going to use, the
            right answer would be to have a form, just like the 213 that we
            could toss the data into and send as a message. I get we don't
            currently have that, but it is something that we could develop. What
            other forms would be want? I believe I heard Aaron talking about
            having a "windshield survey" form. Perhaps get a group of "CARES
            Forms" that people can download and install in their templates. I
            would include things like the ICS213 just so basically everything
            our operators would need would be in once place and there wouldn't
            be a question of which version of a form to be using (there are, I
            believe, at least three different ICS 213 templates, all of which
            are formatted differently).</p>
            
            <p>I would also like to see the use of a Winlink Post Office
            expanded. I have some ideas there, I think...</p>

            <p>Generating ICS-309's. How much info is too much. Should it just
            include received messages or sent and received messages</p>

            <p>I am not real comfortable with using the catalog; some times I
            struggle to find things as I usually use MAC with a virtual machine
            (Parallels)</p>

            <p>I need a bit of practice to remember the various PTT settings
            that are required across the various Digirig, Digirig lite, Masters
            Communication, and Signalink sound cards.</p>
            
            <p>I would have difficulty establishing all required settings to
            employ Soundmodem.</p>
            
            <p>I found that, when I was "rushed" during an exercise, I failed to
            complete all required steps for a "hand off" to a new operator.</p>

            <p>I need help in the purpose of a post office and how to use it,
            how to efficiently transfer ONE photo from my camera to my laptop
            (without the cable connection choosing THOUSANDS), resizing a pdf in
            Winlink (and without buying something like Adobe and using the
            conversion program to .jpg), assessing damage in an area, using some
            of the nifty tools in Winlink to gather data like weather, and a
            whole lot more. For week 151 I ended up trying 2 ways--a scanner and
            my camera; not happy.</p>

            <p>It would be helpful to become acquainted with any other ICS forms
            that are typically used in an event by including them in various
            Winlink Weekly Net exercises. Overall, however there are WAY TOO MAY
            FORMS! SHEESH!</p>

            <p>Better use of RMS (as time allows), converting word docs to .txt</p>

            <p>Aspects that I could use additional exposure to: Basics that I
            don't normally think about, and their shelf life has expired in my
            brain (e.g., terminology, settings in Winlink Express, Vara FM,
            Soundmodem, etc. - my gear is set up, but if Mr. Buzz needs help I
            can't whip through this stuff as quickly as you did last Saturday).
            - Features / Forms / etc. that we might be called upon to use in our
            service to the City of LO or Clackamas County. Fun stuff in the
            Winlink Library like Mean High / Mean Low Tide at the Burnside
            Bridge on Friday.</p>

            <p>Continued work on archiving messages, Tracking position reports</p>

            <p>Finding RMS stations outside of my local area quickly. Adjusting
            settings to optimize speed and through put. Better understanding
            what our served agency expects from us and Winlink. Using multi
            computers and accessing past messages in different instances.</p>

                Question 3: What's good and what's not so good about the format of this
                training net.
            </p>
            <p>I think it's great and I appreciate the constructive feedback</p>
            <p>I like the design of the exercise 6-week series approach.
            Differences between Net Controllers are sometimes appreciated, other
            time not so much. But even then, the variety is good because it can
            exercise the same skills in slightly different ways.</p>
            <p>With such limited time, the exercises aren't too time consuming
            to complete in a weeks time but I think they can be overwhelming for
            new folks. Continuing to advocate that they can just send a simple
            message with a check-in string is great but then on the flip side,
            it doesn't do much to encourage completing the tasks either.</p>
            <p>This style of training is good for me. Once a week is not too
            much and not too little.</p>
            <p>I like there is no "classroom" style training. You are given
            a task. It may take a little research to figure out what to do.
            Although, if needed, support is available.</p>
            <p>the bad ... nothing comes to mind ... except its only 6 weeks long</p>
            <p>Pros: knowing that there's a weekly task to be accomplished.
            Cons: at some point, we may run out of areas to be explored!</p>
            <p>I like the format a lot. The only area where I have questions
            sometimes is feedback on if what I asked was right. Some Net
            controls do a great job of writing up what was expected, others are
            just silent.</p>
            <p>The format is fine. It's a weekly event that I know is coming. I
            try to do it every Friday.</p>
            <p>Good: Always thinking about Winlink procedures on a weekly, if
            not daily, basis. Keeps one close to Winlink.</p>
            <p>Not-so good: Some assignments can be very time-consuming. Some of
            the assignments require research on subjects that are not really
            Winlink-related.</p>
            <p>I think that the relatively short duration of a cycle is a good
            thing ? it allows people to "start" at the "beginning" of the cycle.
            When I was NCS, I went with the idea that my cycle was one shift
            during an event/deployment (and a relatively slow one at that).</p>
            
            <p>I would like to see a "get started" guide that we can link people
            to so new folks can maybe feel more comfortable getting started. I
            know that early on there was some in-depth explanations and such,
            and I appreciate the discussions from NCS operators about the
            reasoning or logic behind what they did and how things work. But I
            think that we could maybe produce a one-page sheet that breaks down
            the check-in sentence, some basic functions (enabling/disabling a
            tactical address, resizing images, attaching files, and retrieving
            attachments). If there is interest, I would be willing to help
            develop that guide.</p>

            <p>At times the tasks get overly complicated and take too much
            time.</p>

            <p>I like the current format but have struggled to decipher
            instructions when in paragraphs (not bullet points or seperation)
            some things have seemed esoteric.</p>

            <p>Good: The opportunity for continued practice; The time
            flexibility allowed by using the weekly format; Receiving a chance
            to revisit useful Winlink practices, such as creating up to four
            "favorite" templates on my tool bar.</p>

            <p>Not so good: I have a hard time identifying what's been "not so
            good." I feel like we have been fortunate to receive such
            high-quality instruction over the past two and one-half years. The
            instruction has been succinct, and the complexity of instruction has
            increased at an appropriate grade.</p>

            <p>I like the format of the training net. With all that's going on I
            need the time to learn the new item each week. I like guidance from
            different people--everyone has a different perspective. I especially
            like the feedback! And this time each week you have given us just
            one more thing.... Excellent.</p>

            <p>The current format of this training net is exceptional since it
            requires participants to use Winlink Express to retrieve and submit
            exercises using Winlink Express. The more we use it, the more
            comfortable we will be with it during a real event.</p>

            <p>Wordy instructions vs. bullet points. I default to printing out
            instructions to prevent having open multiple windows.</p>

            <p>No complaints. The six week cycle / easy to capstone project was
            genius!</p>

            <p>Get people out of their comfort zone and challenge them with the
            material.</p>

            <p>The good has been that it's forcing me to stay more familiar with
            WLE. The bad has been that I realize how powerful WLE and how little
            I know about it.</p>

                Question 4: Would you like to have a go at being the control operator
                for this net? If you don't think you could manage it yourself,
                then would you consider shadowing a more experienced operator?
            </p>
            <p>As discussed prior, I am indeed interested, but currently cannot
            commit to any upcoming 6-week cycles</p>
            <p>No.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I don't think I have the time available at
            present.</p>
            <p>At this point I am not interested in being a control operator. My
            schedule is all over the place so I can't be consistent.</p>
            <p>Eventually. I need a few more sessions. Just too new still.</p>
            <p>I'm willing to help folks who feel like their Winlink skill set
            isn't sufficiently developed to be net control. I think folks are
            doubly-challenged: they need to handle the mechanics of the net, and
            they need to come up with new ways to challenge net
            participants.</p>
            <p>I would like to be control operator in the future, but my medical
            issues are challenging by capacity right now. That will have to
            wait.</p>
            <p>No/no. (My computer skills and knowledge are insufficient.)</p>
            <p>I have taken the NCS job before, and I would not mind taking it
            again (perhaps some time in the new year). I have, at the same time,
            recommended to a couple of people that I thought would be good
            candidates for the NCS job that they consider it. One of the nice
            things that we have is the Common Operating Picture (thank you,
            Andrew, for keeping that up) ? with a list of folks who have been
            NCS before, you always have people you can talk to ? the team is
            there.</p>
            
            <p>It often sounds silly, but it really is true that one of the best
            ways to learn something is to teach it. I found ways that I
            unintentionally broke things and won't be making those mistakes
            again in the future. Having to go through a couple dozen check-ins a
            week shows you what details are often missed, and is good training
            for how to politely correct behaviour. This is something we will
            need to do with our served agency partners occasionally (how do we
            tell someone that we can't send something in a kind but firm way
            kind of thing).</p>

            <p>No time.</p>

            <p>At some point I would like to shadow. I need to first feel
            overall more comfortable.</p>

            <p>I'm ready to take on another set of weeks, especially if I can
            work with another operator to receive review of my work.</p>

            <p>I absolutely cannot consider being a control operator for this
            net. I do not know the information well enough.</p>

            <p>Not yet. Need more training first.</p>

            <p>Not at this time. Too much else going on in my/our lives. Kudos to those who are NCO.</p>

            <p>If you can tolerate me, I'm willing to pilot the ship when asked.
            Sometimes the greatest help I can provide is to shut up and sit down
            - there is a fine line between helping out and gett'n in the way. My
            preference would be to limit my time as NCS to two six week cycles
            per year. As always, I welcome your input as I navigate my six week
            cycle.</p>

            <p>I will do more Net Control.</p>

            <p>I'm not yet ready to take on the role of Control Operator. I'm
            still very much a student, but won't say never, just not yet.</p>

                Question 5: What are we missing? Keep it Winlink Express usage or
                process specific, please.
            </p>
            <p>A Live Exercise on a Saturday from multiple subgroups/locations</p>
            <p>The flow of paper through the Winlink workstation could use some
            definition, IMO. From the moment a message arrives (as a verbal,
            "napkin," 213 Form, formal document, or as an incoming Winlink
            transmission); through its intermediate handling (whether
            transcribed to 213 verbatim, edited/paraphrased onto 213,
            scanned/photographed and attached to 213, printed out); then, if
            needed, its transmission (how to properly fill in the blanks); and
            finally its ultimate disposition and storage (hand-off to addressee,
            paper copies, electronic folders, 309s). And the numbering system,
            for new and related messages, verbal and Winlink, needs firming
            up.</p>
            <p>Perhaps a bit more usage of the "Post Office" configuration so
            folks gain more understanding on how that works.</p>
            <p>I think trouble shooting the Winlink connection procedure and
            computer settings would be a good idea as they are different with
            some radios.</p>
            <p>What about non-Winlink Express software? I was specifically
            thinking of PAT Winlink for LINUX systems.</p>
            <p>I feel like we've hit the topics that LOFD is expecting.
            Internals of Winlink Express would be interesting to a few, but not
            many, of us.</p>
            <p>I think I mentioned before are actual usage during a call out. I
            am not sure people remember the How Tos that have been written and
            what will really happen. I submitted items like how do we do message
            numbers vs voice and how to integrate the 309? Also the winlink
            generated 309 misses the message number unless we establish a
            convention in message titles. All operational stuff for our ops
            manual.</p>
            
            <p>After leading our training intro yesterday I do feel people are
            getting the message to be active on the net. Just want to make sure
            we educate on our processes too (sprinkled into the net and
            meetings).</p>
            <p>The weekly Winlink Net has proven to be a success in terms of its
            availability, skills, and learning. Participation is still an issue.
            Always an issue handling that.</p>
            <p>From my perspective, nothing is missing. I have come a long way
            from where I started for which I thank you and the Winlink team.</p>

            <p>The foundations are good. The forms that we are using are the
            ones that I think we are most likely to use. I like the little
            quirks that each NCS puts into their cycle ? keeps things fresh and
            interesting even though most of the tasks at their base level are
            the same.</p>
            
            <p>The main thing that is missing is the urgency that people will
            feel during a deployment, I think. The chaos, the noise?</p>
            
            <p>The other think that we need to do more of is operate from the
            field. It would be great to have all of our operators be
            field-capable and practice that regularly.</p>

            <p>Nothing that I can think off.</p>

            <p>Beyond me. At this point I feel I am beyond beginner maybe
            approaching intermediate</p>

            <p>We need a larger cadre of Winlink operators. What can we do to
            create this cadre?</p>

            <p>This one is a blank. I enjoy it, I learn each week, I feel a
            sense of accomplishment, and don't know exactly what I don't know.
            Thanks for asking these questions.</p>

            <p>Never assume the Winlink operator is computer savvy,
            within/without Winlink.</p>

            <p>I don't know what I don't know. Your experience with different
            deployments, as a volunteer in supporting activities outside of LO
            ARES or CARES really helps explain why it is important to be in
            command of certain skills. Any direction that you might provide
            regarding activities outside of LO ARES, CARES, or other Winlink
            Nets in which I participate would be welcomed.</p>

            <p>N/A</p>

            <p>The stress aspect of a real event and the portable operating in
            less than ideal conditions. Having to figure it out on the fly when
            you haven't yet learned the skills or understand the "proper" way.
            I've used the analogy before of "turning my homework in with red
            crayon" because I wasn't yet skilled enough to do it right. It may
            be interesting to have more assignments that give us a task but have
            little to no instructions on how to achieve the task.</p>
